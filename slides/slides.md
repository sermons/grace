for it is the **power** of God <br>
for **salvation** to everyone who believes, <br>
to the **Jew** first and also to the **Greek**. 

[17](# "ref")
For in it the **righteousness** of God <br>
is revealed from **faith** for faith, <br>
as it is written, <br>
“The righteous shall **live by faith**.”

[Romans 1:16-17 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ God's **power** not only in righteous **judgment**

+ Our **salvation** not only from own **mistakes**

+ God's election of **Israel** and **mystery** of 
  + gospel brought to **ends of earth**
+ The **righteousness** not earned by own piety
  + but **granted** by God 
  + and **obtained** by faith
+ Reflected in approx **outline** of the book:

Therefore, since we have been **justified** by faith,<br>
we have **peace** with God <br>
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Through him we have also obtained **access** <br>

Not only that, but we rejoice in our **sufferings**, <br>
knowing that suffering produces **endurance**, <br>
[4](# "ref")
and endurance produces **character**, <br>
and character produces **hope**, <br>
[5](# "ref")
and hope does not put us to shame, 

because God's **love** has been poured into our hearts <br>
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

so that the **tested genuineness** <br>
of your faith — more precious than **gold** <br>
that perishes though it is tested by fire — 

may be found to result in **praise** and glory <br>
and honor at the **revelation** of Jesus Christ.

  + God really **loves** me?
+ The assurance is **manner** in which God loved us:

---
For while we were still weak, <br>
at the right time **Christ died** for the ungodly. 

[7](# "ref")
For one will scarcely die for a **righteous** person<br>
-- though perhaps for a good person <br>
one would dare even to die --

[Romans 5:6-7 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ v7: not **contrast** but **appositive**:
+ maybe you might **die** for a person / cause
  + if you felt it was **worthwhile**:
+ if your **death** would call attention to 
  + the **worthiness** of the person / cause
+ emph contrast w/v6/8: for the **ungodly**, sinners

---
but God shows his **love** for us in that <br>
while we were still **sinners**, Christ died for us. 

[Romans 5:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ God did not **wait** for us to become worthy
  + before sending His **Son** to die for us
+ It's already **done**! Before you **repented**,
  + before you **sinned**, before you were **born**
+ This is the **manner** in which God caused His
  + actions + words to **stand together**
  + to **demonstrate** + substantiate 
  + the depth of His **love** toward us
+ What more **proof** are we looking for?

---
Since, therefore, we have now been <br>
**justified** by his blood, much more shall we be <br>
**saved** by him from the **wrath** of God. 

[10](# "ref")
For if while we were **enemies** we were <br>
**reconciled** to God by the death of his Son, 

much more, now that we are reconciled, <br>
shall we be **saved** by his life. 

[Romans 5:9-10 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Yes, we **owe** an indescribable **debt** to God
  + Because of our **rebellion** against His auth
  + He is **justified** in His **wrath** (ch1,3)
+ But God **settled** the accounts already
  + **paid** the debt by Jesus' death
+ Jesus' **last words** on the cross?
  + "It is **finished**": not His **life**,
  + but the **work** of salvation
+ Through **faith** in Christ (faith of Abe)
  + we **receive** this reconciliation
+ So **why** would we still fear God's **punish**?
  + why assume God is not **pleased** with us?
+ In fact, it's not just that we not longer
  + **owe** anything to God:

---
More than that, we also **rejoice** in God <br>
through our Lord Jesus Christ, <br>
through whom we have now received **reconciliation**.

[Romans 5:11 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "rejoice": again, **boast**, pride, lift up head
+ pride not in **selves** but **Christ**
  + who **bought** our reconciliation
+ He is our **peace**, who has broken down 
  + the wall of **enmity**
+ between man to man
  + between man and God

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# How do I **know** that the Father **loves** me?

>>>
+ Bc I'm **lovable**?  Nope!
+ Our **assurance** is in **manner** in which God loved
+ sent His Son while we were yet **weak**,
  + ungodly, sinners, His **enemies**
+ Bc we didn't **deserve** His love, 
  + so we know we can't **lose** it!
+ God will not **reneg** on His love,
+ and nothing in all creation is **strong** enough 
  + to **separate** us from His love

## Romans 5: Grace Victorious
1. Pride: in Future Hope + Present Suffering [(1-5)](# "ref")
1. Peace: in the Father's Love [(6-11)](# "ref")
1. **Power: in Grace Greater Than Sin** [(12-21)](# "ref")

>>>
+ In light of the **power** of God's love
  + manifest in Christ's death for us
+ We can trust in the boundless **abundance**
  + of His **grace**
+ which **overwhelms** sin and the curse of death

---
Therefore, just as **sin** came into the world <br>
through one **man**, and **death** through sin, 

and so death spread to **all** men because all sinned -- 

[Romans 5:12 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ v12-14 first ack **rule** of death in our world:
+ v12 is **self-contained** clause:
+ **just as** sin came to world,
  + **so also** death came to all people
+ death (spiritual and physical) in the **world**
  + is a **conseq** of sin
  + (problem for theistic evolutionists!)
+ not just **Adam's** fault, **all** have sinned

---
for **sin** indeed was in the world <br>
**before** the law was given, 

but sin is not **counted** where there is no law. 

[Romans 5:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ studying Bible helps us **realize** how we've sinned
  + **compass** to guide us straight + true
+ w/o it, don't know what dir is **North**
+ don't **realize** we've wandered astray from God
  + assume **everyone** lives like this
  + so should be **ok**

---
Yet **death reigned** from Adam to Moses, 

even over those whose sinning was <br>
not like the **transgression of Adam**, <br>
who was a type of the one who was to come.

[Romans 5:14 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Adam had direct **command** from God
  + Moses rcvd God's specific **regulations**
+ But still possible to **overstep**
  + God's prescribed **boundaries**
  + even **unknowingly**
+ e.g., didn't know must **park** facing right way
  + but **ignorance** no excuse
+ Do God's **expectations** of holiness
  + only **apply** to Christians?
+ Even if diff **culture** / relig bg
  + **sin** + death still reigns in heart (ch2)
+ But there's **hope**!

---
## 3. Grace Greater than Sin
1. God's grace far **exceeds** the results of sin [(v15)](# "ref")
1. Jesus' death covers **all** our sins [(v16)](# "ref")
1. God's grace will bring a new **kingdom** [(v17)](# "ref")
1. Christ's obedience changes our **standing** before God [(v18-19)](# "ref")

>>>
+ repeatedly draws **parallel** between
+ Adam's **sin** vs Christ's **sacrifice** for us
+ one resulting in **death** + condemnation
+ the other resulting in **life** + being deemed **righteous**
+ But in each comparison, **grace** wins!

---
But the free **gift** is not like the trespass. 

For if many **died** through one man's trespass, 

much more have the **grace** of God <br>
and the free gift by the grace of that <br>
one man Jesus Christ **abounded** for many. 

[Romans 5:15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not equal duality: **yin-yang**, good/evil, God/devil
+ (1) God's grace is **bigger** than death from sin
+ "abounds": surpass, **exceed** normal, overflow
+ Trying to be good by following the **rules**
  + means if you mess up **once**, you're **done**:
+ **One** sin brings condemnation + death
+ But God's grace is **greater** than sin
  + bc it's not like that:

---
And the free gift is not like <br>
the result of that **one man's sin**. 

For the judgment following **one trespass**<br>
brought condemnation, 

but the free gift following **many trespasses**<br>
brought justification. 

[Romans 5:16 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "For it is not as though bc one man's sin came the gift"
+ Jesus died not just to pay for **one** man's sin
+ (2) Jesus' death covers over **all** our sins
  + one vs **many**
+ on the **one hand**: the judgment 
  + out of one (sin), into condemnation
+ on the **other**: the gift 
  + out of many sins, into justification
+ It's also a matter of **power** / rule:

---
For if, because of one man's trespass, <br>
**death reigned** through that one man, 

much more will **those who receive** the abundance <br>
of grace and the free gift of righteousness <br>
**reign in life** through the one man Jesus Christ.

[Romans 5:17 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (3) God's grace will bring a new **kingdom**
+ Now operate under rule of **death**: barely surviving
+ But bc of Christ's gift, **we** will reign!
+ How does this affect how God **sees** us?

---
Therefore, as **one trespass** led to <br>
condemnation for all men, 

so **one act of righteousness** leads to <br>
justification and life for all men. 

[19](# "ref")
For as by the one man's disobedience <br>
the many were **made sinners**, 

so by the one man's obedience <br>
the many will be **made righteous**. 

[Romans 5:18-19 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **disobedience** vs obedience
+ "made": **set down**, put in place, give position/auth
+ (4) Christ's obedience changes our **standing** before Him
  + **deemed** righteous in His sight
+ Then what of the **world**?  Will it get **better**?
  + Downhill trajectory: **V-shaped** recovery? U?
+ No, in fact as in the days of **Noah**
  + God has reserved world for **judgment**
  + this time by **fire**

---
Now the **law** came in to **increase** the trespass, <br>
but where **sin** increased, <br>
**grace** abounded all the more, 

[21](# "ref")
so that, as sin **reigned** in death, <br>
grace also might **reign** through righteousness <br>
leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Romans 5:20-21 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ being **told** what not to do
  + makes one **want** to do it even more (ch7)
+ so not only does world **increase** in sin/death
  + but preaching **gospel** increases it even more!
+ So all **hopeless**? No! **Grace** abounds even more
+ As in days of **Noah**, God has provided a singular
  + **way** to be rescued: not **ark**, but
+ **faith** in Jesus Christ, God's Son given for our sins
+ The more we **recognize** our own sin
  + the more **precious** God's grace becomes
+ He who is **forgiven** little, **loves** little (Lk 7:47)
