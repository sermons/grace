照樣，因一人的順從，<br>
眾人也成為義了。

+ **disobedience** vs obedience
+ "made": **set down**, put in place, give position/auth
+ (4) Christ's obedience changes our **standing** before Him
  + **deemed** righteous in His sight
+ Then what of the **world**?  Will it get **better**?
  + Downhill trajectory: **V-shaped** recovery? U?
+ No, in fact as in the days of **Noah**
  + God has reserved world for **judgment**
  + this time by **fire**

Now the **law** came in to **increase** the trespass,
but where **sin** increased, <br>
**grace** abounded all the more, 

律法本是外添的，叫過犯顯多；<br>
只是罪在那裡顯多，恩典就更顯多了。

so that, as sin **reigned** in death, <br>
grace also might **reign** through righteousness <br>
leading to eternal life <br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

就如罪作王叫人死；<br>
照樣，恩典也藉著義作王，<br>
叫人因我們的主耶穌基督得永生。

+ being **told** what not to do
  + makes one **want** to do it even more (ch7)
+ so not only does world **increase** in sin/death
  + but preaching **gospel** increases it even more!
+ So all **hopeless**? No! **Grace** abounds even more
+ As in days of **Noah**, God has provided a singular
  + **way** to be rescued: not **ark**, but
+ **faith** in Jesus Christ, God's Son given for our sins
+ The more we **recognize** our own sin
  + the more **precious** God's grace becomes
+ He who is **forgiven** little, **loves** little (Lk 7:47)

  + even sneaking suspicion He doesn't **care**

+ Rom5 reminds us God's grace is **sufficient**:

+ O Lord, how long shall I cry for help,
  + and you will not hear?
+ Or cry to you “Violence!” and you will not save?
+ Destruction and violence are before me;
  + strife and contention arise.
+ So the law is paralyzed,
  + and justice never goes forth.
+ But the righteous shall live by his faith.
+ The Lord is in his holy temple;
  + let all the earth keep silence before him.
+ Though the fig tree should not blossom,
  + nor fruit be on the vines,
+ yet I will rejoice in the Lord;
  + I will take joy in the God of my salvation.
