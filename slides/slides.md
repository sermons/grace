Therefore, since we have been **justified** by faith,<br>
we have **peace** with God <br>
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

[2](# "ref")
Through him we have also obtained **access** <br>
by faith into this **grace** in which we stand, 

and we **rejoice** in hope of the glory of God. 

[Romans 5:1-2 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ all 1 **sentence**
+ "justified": made/decreed to be **righteous**
  + promise to **Abe** + all w/same faith
+ "peace": **reconciled** w/God
  + saved from righteous **wrath**
+ "grace": our current **status** before God
  + access: **led** forth/into, not earned
  + have obtained: perfective, already completed
+ "rejoice": **boast**, pride in future **hope**

---
Not only that, but we rejoice in our **sufferings**, <br>
knowing that suffering produces **endurance**, <br>
[4](# "ref")
and endurance produces **character**, <br>
and character produces **hope**, <br>
[5](# "ref")
and hope does not put us to shame, 

because God's **love** has been poured into our hearts <br>
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

[Romans 5:3-5 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>

---
For while we were still weak, <br>
at the right time **Christ died** for the ungodly. 

[7](# "ref")
For one will scarcely die for a **righteous** person<br>
-- though perhaps for a good person <br>
one would dare even to die --

[8](# "ref")
but God shows his **love** for us in that <br>
while we were still **sinners**, Christ died for us. 

[Romans 5:6-8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ v7: not **contrast** but **appositive**
+ emph contrast w/v6/8: for the **ungodly**, sinners

---
Since, therefore, we have now been <br>
**justified** by his blood, much more shall we be <br>
**saved** by him from the **wrath** of God. 

[10](# "ref")
For if while we were enemies we were <br>
**reconciled** to God by the death of his Son, 

much more, now that we are reconciled, <br>
shall we be **saved** by his life. 

[Romans 5:9-10 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ reconciled wrt **debt** owed to God
+ saved from God's righteous **wrath**: ch1, 3

---
More than that, we also **rejoice** in God <br>
through our Lord Jesus Christ, <br>
through whom we have now received reconciliation.

[Romans 5:11 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not just settled debts, but **boast**
+ pride not in **selves** but **Christ**
  + who **bought** our reconciliation

---
Therefore, just as **sin** came into the world <br>
through one **man**, and **death** through sin, 

and so death spread to **all** men because all sinned -- 

[Romans 5:12 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **just as** sin came to world,
  + **so also** death came to all people
+ death (spiritual and physical) in the **world**
  + is a **conseq** of sin
  + (problem for theistic evolutionists!)
+ not just **Adam's** fault, **all** have sinned

---
for **sin** indeed was in the world <br>
**before** the law was given, 

but sin is not **counted** where there is no law. 

[Romans 5:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ studying Bible helps us **realize** how we've sinned
+ w/o it, we don't **know** we've done wrong
  + assume **everyone** lives like this
  + so should be **ok**

---
Yet **death reigned** from Adam to Moses, 

even over those whose sinning was <br>
not like the transgression of Adam, <br>
who was a type of the one who was to come.

[Romans 5:14 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Adam had direct **command** from God
  + Moses rcvd God's specific **regulations**
+ but still possible to **overstep**
  + God's prescribed **boundaries**
  + even **unknowingly**
+ e.g., didn't know must **park** facing right way
  + but **ignorance** no excuse
+ do God's **expectations** of holiness
  + only **apply** to Christians?
+ (ch2) even if diff **culture** / relig bg
  + **sin** + death still reigns in heart

---
But the free **gift** is not like the trespass. 

For if many **died** through one man's trespass, 

much more have the **grace** of God <br>
and the free gift by the grace of that <br>
one man Jesus Christ **abounded** for many. 

[Romans 5:15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (1) God's grace is **bigger** than death from sin
+ "abounds": surpass, **exceed** normal, overflow

---
And the free gift is not like <br>
the result of that **one man's sin**. 

For the judgment following **one trespass**<br>
brought condemnation, 

but the free gift following **many trespasses**<br>
brought justification. 

[Romans 5:16 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (2) God's grace covers over **all** our sins
+ "For it is not as though because of one man's sin came the gift"
+ on the one hand: the judgment 
  + out of one, into condemnation
+ on the other: the gift 
  + out of many sins, into justification
+ one vs **many**

---
For if, because of one man's trespass, <br>
**death reigned** through that one man, 

much more will **those who receive** the abundance <br>
of grace and the free gift of righteousness <br>
**reign in life** through the one man Jesus Christ.

[Romans 5:17 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (3) God's grace will bring a new **kingdom**
+ operate under rule of **death**: barely surviving
+ **we** will reign bc of Christ's gift

---
Therefore, as **one trespass** led to <br>
condemnation for all men, 

so **one act of righteousness** leads to <br>
justification and life for all men. 

[19](# "ref")
For as by the one man's disobedience <br>
the many were **made sinners**, 

so by the one man's obedience <br>
the many will be **made righteous**. 

[Romans 5:18-19 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (4) God's grace changes our **standing** before Him
+ **disobedience** vs obedience
+ "made": **set down**, put in place, give position/authority

---
Now the **law** came in to **increase** the trespass, <br>
but where **sin** increased, <br>
**grace** abounded all the more, 

[21](# "ref")
so that, as sin **reigned** in death, <br>
grace also might **reign** through righteousness <br>
leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

[Romans 5:20-21 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ being **told** what not to do
  + makes us **want** to do it even more (ch7)
+ so not only does world **increase** in sin/death
  + but preaching **gospel** increases it even more!
+ So is it all **hopeless**? No!
  + **grace** abounds even more
+ The more we **recognize** our own sin
  + the more **precious** God's grace becomes
+ He who is **forgiven** little, **loves** little (Lk 7:47)
